# cpts360-lab-1-template

Follow KC's write up of the assignment here: https://eecs.wsu.edu/~cs360/LAB1.html

Place your code soley in the t.c files in each respective folders for part1 and part2 (t.c is just KC's convention). 

Ensure that your code will compile and run when the ./mk script is ran. That is how we are batch compiling and testing output on the backend so ./mk needs to work for us to see that your code works. You may need to change the mk script, that is totally fine. If we omitted anything important from it, please let us know and we wil update it in our template repository. 



# To Turn In:
Push your files to our GitHub classroom (See Zach's How-To Linux as a reference if you don't know how to submit). 
    - Link: https://eecs.wsu.edu/~cs360/ta_resources/howto-linux-cmds.html
NOTE: We are are running a batch test when your code is submitted to ensure that the code compiles. You code will need to compile for us to look at it. The test simply runs the `mk` file and then checks to see an executable is created. If the test is ever changed we will be verbose about what it is looking for.

# A Call To Make CS360 Better
If you would like to help other students in future CS360 classes and think you can make this template repo better, please do a pull request (or email us) and add your changes. We will review them and incorporate them. 
This is the first semester we are implementing Github Classroom and thus we are making each template in real time as KC posts the assignments so will make mistakes and things will get missed. We appreciate your help and understanding.
